# Flink AWS Managed

This project is based on the Manged Service for Apache Flink blueprint project. The project creates a managed flink application using python scripts.

CDK has also an [official support to setup a managed flink application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-kinesisanalytics-flink-alpha.Application.html), which is not used in this application.
